# AI Avatar Registration App

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive registration system for an AI Avatar application. The system includes backend functionality, integration with a MongoDB database hosted on Azure Cosmos DB, and placeholders for both web and mobile frontend development.

## Project Structure
- **`/backend`**: Contains the backend code (Flask app and related routes).
- **`/web`**: Placeholder for the web frontend (React JS).
- **`/mobile`**: Placeholder for the mobile frontend (React Native).

## Backend
- Flask application running on a server in Azure.
- Connected to MongoDB (Azure Cosmos DB) for database management.
- Allows user registration through the `/register` endpoint.

## Requirements

### Mobile
- Developed using React Native for mobile devices.

### Web
- Developed using React JS for the website.

### Server
- Backend built with Python and deployed on Azure cloud.
- Database managed using MongoDB (Azure Cosmos DB).

### Additional Functionality
- After registration, the user receives a Toast message to confirm successful registration.

## Status
- The backend is running on an Azure server and is connected to MongoDB (Azure Cosmos DB) for managing user data.
- Frontend development is in progress.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the root directory:
   ```bash
   cd [project-root]
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. The backend is running on an Azure server but you can run the Flask app locally:
   ```bash
   python backend/main.py
   ```

## Future Development
- **Frontend:**
  - Web: React JS interface for user registration.
  - Mobile: React Native interface for user registration.
